# Diffusion Coefficient Calculator

This project is an interactive tool for calculating the diffusion coefficient (D_AB) using an approach inspired by the UNIQUAC equation. It is implemented in Python with interactive widgets via ipywidgets.

## Features
- Calculation of the diffusion coefficient based on physicochemical parameters.
- Interactive user interface to adjust parameters.
- Comparison with an experimental value (D_exp) and calculation of the relative error.

## Usage
1. Run the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Adjust the parameters using the interactive widgets.
3. Click on "Calculate D_AB" to get the result.

## Installation
To use this project locally, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy ipywidgets
